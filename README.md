## Introduction

This project, part of an individual assignment, explores customer behaviour on an e-commerce platform using anonymised clickstream data. The aim is to uncover insights that aid in understanding consumer engagement with different review types and product pages, as well as capturing user journey patterns across various website elements.

---

## Project Context

The dataset comprises:

- **Clickstream Data**: Captures user actions and page views, including timestamps, IP addresses, and session identifiers.
- **Product Reviews**: Contains three types of reviewsâ€”celebrity recommendations, customer reviews, and video reviews created by the company.
- **Registered User Data**: Includes user demographics, such as birthdate and gender.

A presentation on the analysis outcomes is also included, and if youâ€™re interested in further details on this project, please reach out.

## Analysis Overview

Key analytical steps in the Jupyter Notebook (`Project.ipynb`) include:

1. **Influence of Reviews**: Compared the impact of celebrity, customer, and video reviews on customer engagement and purchasing decisions.
2. **Customer Journey Mapping**: Developed methods to capture and illustrate customer journeys across review pages and product pages.
3. **Additional EDA**: Examined patterns in consumer interactions, purchasing rates, and clickstream behaviour.

## Insights and Findings

The following insights were derived from the analysis:

- **Review Influence on Purchases**: 
  - Celebrity reviews showed a higher engagement rate compared to customer and video reviews. However, customer reviews had a more consistent influence on purchase decisions across various product categories.
  - Video reviews had the least direct impact on purchases but helped improve overall engagement by retaining users on product pages longer.

- **Customer Journey Patterns**:
  - Users who engaged with multiple review types (e.g., celebrity and customer reviews) were more likely to convert than those who only viewed a single type.
  - A common user journey involved initial engagement with a celebrity review, followed by exploration of customer reviews, which often led to a purchase.

- **Conversion Rate Insights**:
  - The data highlighted peak engagement times, showing higher purchase rates during specific hours and days, which could guide targeted marketing efforts.
  - Users from particular demographics and regions showed a greater likelihood of conversion after engaging with celebrity reviews.

These insights indicate that a combined review strategyâ€”leveraging celebrity, customer, and video reviews in tandemâ€”may enhance customer engagement and conversion rates.
